TESTING WORKFLOW:
================
1. Start server with: node app.js
2. Create a disaster using POST with Sri Lankan location data
3. Get list of IDs to find your created disaster
4. Test READ to see all disasters
5. Test UPDATE to modify disaster details
6. Test GET ONE to retrieve specific disaster
7. Test DELETE to archive the disaster

All responses include "test_note" field confirming these are test endpoints.
