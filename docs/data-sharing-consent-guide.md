# Data Sharing Consent Guide

## Overview
The National Disaster Platform mobile app implements a comprehensive data sharing consent system that allows citizens to control how their data is shared with government agencies through the National Data Exchange (NDX) system.

## How Data Sharing Consent Works

### 1. Consent Management Screen
Users can access the consent management system through:
- **Dashboard**: Tap the "üîê Consent" button
- **Navigation**: Go to "Data Sharing Consent" from the main menu

### 2. Available Data Providers
The app connects to several government agencies:
- **Disaster Management Department**: Real-time disaster alerts and risk assessments
- **Weather Service**: Weather warnings and forecasts
- **Health Ministry**: Health-related emergency information
- **Transport Ministry**: Road conditions and transport alerts

### 3. Consent Request Process
1. **Request Consent**: User requests permission to share data with a specific agency
2. **Review Purpose**: System shows what data will be shared and why
3. **User Approval**: User explicitly approves or denies the consent
4. **Duration**: Consents expire after 24 hours for security
5. **Revocation**: Users can revoke consent at any time

### 4. Data Types Shared
- **Location Data**: For emergency response and nearby risk assessment
- **Disaster Reports**: User-submitted incident reports
- **SOS Signals**: Emergency location data when SOS is activated
- **Risk Assessments**: Local disaster risk calculations

### 5. Security Features
- **Purpose-Specific**: Each consent is for a specific purpose (emergency-response, safety-notifications)
- **Time-Limited**: Consents automatically expire after 24 hours
- **User Control**: Users can view, approve, and revoke all consents
- **Local Storage**: Consents stored locally for offline access
- **Encrypted**: All data transmission is encrypted

### 6. Benefits of Consent
- **Enhanced Disaster Information**: Access to comprehensive disaster data
- **Personalized Alerts**: Location-based emergency notifications
- **Better Risk Assessment**: More accurate local risk calculations
- **Government Coordination**: Improved emergency response coordination

### 7. Privacy Protection
- **Minimal Data**: Only necessary data is shared
- **User Control**: Complete control over what data is shared
- **Transparency**: Clear information about data usage
- **Compliance**: Follows government data protection guidelines

## User Experience Flow

3. If consent expired ‚Üí prompts for renewal
4. User can manage consents anytime

### Emergency Situations
