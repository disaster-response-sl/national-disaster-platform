# Risk Map and Data Sharing Consent Fixes

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. Data Sharing Consent System

**Issue**: Users were unclear about how data sharing consent works in the mobile app.

**Solution**: Created comprehensive documentation and improved the consent management system.

**Changes Made**:
- Created `docs/data-sharing-consent-guide.md` with detailed explanation
- The consent system allows users to control data sharing with government agencies
- Users can request, approve, and revoke consents for different data types
- Consents expire after 24 hours for security
- All data sharing is purpose-specific and user-controlled

**How to Access**:
- From Dashboard: Tap the "üîê Consent" button
- From Navigation: Go to "Data Sharing Consent" screen
- Users can manage consents for Disaster Management, Weather Service, Health Ministry, and Transport Ministry

### 2. Risk Map Zoom Level

**Issue**: The map was not properly zoomed to show Sri Lanka fully.

**Solution**: Updated the LeafletMap component to center on Sri Lanka with appropriate zoom level.

**Changes Made**:
- Updated initial map view to center on Sri Lanka coordinates: `[7.8731, 80.7718]`
- Changed zoom level from 4 to 8 for better visibility of the country
- Updated fallback view to also center on Sri Lanka
- Map now properly shows the entire country when loaded

**Technical Details**:
```javascript
// Before
map.setView([20, 78], 4);

// After  
map.setView([7.8731, 80.7718], 8); // Sri Lanka center with zoom level 8
```

### 3. Limited Disaster Display

**Issue**: Only one disaster was shown when there are 10 disasters in the database.

**Root Cause**: 
- Backend API was filtering only for `status: 'active'` disasters
- "Show All Disasters" toggle was off by default
- API limit was set to 10 disasters

**Solution**: Updated both backend and frontend to show all disasters by default.

**Backend Changes** (`src/web-dashboard/backend/routes/mobileAuth.routes.js`):
- Modified `/api/mobile/disasters` endpoint to return all disasters (active and resolved)
- Added optional status filtering via query parameter
- Increased limit from 10 to 50 disasters
- Now returns both active and resolved disasters

**Frontend Changes** (`src/MobileApp/screens/RiskMapScreen.tsx`):
- Changed default value of `showAllDisasters` from `false` to `true`
- Added informational text to explain the difference between modes
- Users now see all disasters by default

**API Changes**:
```javascript
// Before: Only active disasters
const disasters = await Disaster.find({ status: 'active' }).limit(10);

// After: All disasters with optional filtering
const { status } = req.query;
let query = {};
if (status) {
  query.status = status;
}
const disasters = await Disaster.find(query).limit(50);
```

### 4. User Interface Improvements

**Added Features**:
- Informational text explaining the toggle functionality
- Better visual feedback for different disaster modes
- Improved map centering and zoom levels
- Enhanced user experience with clearer explanations

## Data Analysis

Based on your provided disaster data, the system now correctly shows:

**Total Disasters**: 10 disasters in the database
- **Active Disasters**: 5 (landslide, cyclone, landslide, cyclone, flood)
- **Resolved Disasters**: 5 (flood, cyclone, cyclone, flood, landslide)

**Disaster Types**:
- **Flood**: 3 disasters
- **Landslide**: 4 disasters  
- **Cyclone**: 3 disasters

**Severity Levels**:
- **High**: 3 disasters
- **Medium**: 4 disasters
- **Low**: 3 disasters

## How to Test the Fixes

1. **Map Zoom**: Open the Risk Map screen - it should now center on Sri Lanka with proper zoom level
2. **Disaster Display**: You should now see all 10 disasters instead of just 1
3. **Toggle Functionality**: 
   - Toggle ON: Shows all 10 disasters (active + resolved)
   - Toggle OFF: Shows only 5 active disasters
4. **Consent Management**: Navigate to Consent Management screen to manage data sharing permissions

## Benefits of These Fixes

1. **Better User Experience**: Users can see all relevant disaster information
2. **Improved Map Navigation**: Sri Lanka is properly centered and visible
3. **Enhanced Data Access**: Users have control over data sharing with government agencies
4. **Clearer Information**: Better explanations of what data is being shown
5. **Comprehensive View**: Users can choose between all disasters or only active ones

The risk map now provides a complete view of disaster information while maintaining user privacy through the consent management system.
